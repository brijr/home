### About

I am a designer and developer from Utah. I work as a design engineer and AI developer at a marketing software company called [Ampry](https://ampry.com).

I belong to the intersection of design, code, and marketing. After studying marketing in university, I started my career as a product designer for marketing tech before diving into software design and development.

Thanks for visiting and feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:bridgertower@gmail.com). Always looking to collaborate and learn from others.
