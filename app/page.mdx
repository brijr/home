### About

I am a designer and developer from Utah. I work as a design engineer and AI developer at a marketing software company called [Ampry](https://ampry.com). I am also a technical entreprenuer building [Alpine Codex](https://alpinecodex.com) and [9d8](https://9d8.dev).

I belong to the intersection of design, code, and marketing. After studying marketing in university, I started my career as a produce designer before diving into software design and development.

I studied [Product Management](https://pm.umd.edu/program/mppm/) at the University of Maryland before transfering to Georgia Tech to study Human Computer Interaction in the [Masters of Computer Science](https://omscs.gatech.edu/) program.

Thanks for visiting and feel free to reach out to me. Always looking to collaborate and learn from others.
