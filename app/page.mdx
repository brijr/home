### About

I am a designer and developer from Utah. I work as a design engineer at [Ampry](https://ampry.com). I founded [Zion Design](https://zion.surf) and I am currently building [Alpine Codex](https://alpinecodex.com) and [9d8](https://9d8.dev) to deliver next-gen performance marketing software.

I belong to the intersection of design, code, and marketing. After studying marketing in university, I started my career as a marketing designer before diving into software design and development.

Thanks for visiting and feel free to reach out to me. Always looking to collaborate and learn from others.
